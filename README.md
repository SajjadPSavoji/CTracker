# CTracker (ECCV2020)

<!-- my implementation  of **Chained-Tracker** as described in [Chained-Tracker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14557). -->
 
The introduction video of CTracker is uploaded to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UovwAgKys88).

Report is [here](https://github.com/SajjadPSavoji/CTracker/tree/main/Report).

My own presentation is [here](https://github.com/SajjadPSavoji/CTracker/tree/main/Presentation).

## Organize MOT17 dataset
MOT17 dataset can be downloaded at [MOTChallenge](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17Det/).
<!-- 
We uses two CSV files to organize the MOT17 dataset: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping. 

We provide the two CSV files for MOT17 with codes in the CTRACKER_ROOT/data, you should copy them to MOT17_ROOT before starting training. 

### Dataset structures:
```
MOT17_ROOT/
        |->train/
        |    |->MOT17-02/
        |    |->MOT17-04/
        |    |->...
        |->test/
        |    |->MOT17-01/
        |    |->MOT17-03/
        |    |->...
        |->train_annots.csv
        |->train_labels.csv
```
MOT17_ROOT is your path of the MOT17 Dataset.
 -->

### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,id,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

The MOT17 CSV file can be generated by generate_csv.py:
```
python generate_csv.py
```
<!-- You can modify this script to handle other datasets. -->

### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
person,0
```
